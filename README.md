# linuxutils
Sundry utilities, so I don't forget them.

## Notable

- [toggle_finger_touch.sh](toggle_finger_touch.sh) : turns finger (but not pen) input off for Lenovo X220t
- [remap_dell.sh](remap_dell.sh): recalibrate touch screen after (dis)connecting a second monitor (touch or not), for Lenovo X220t. Might need manual changes after updates to the X11 server - depends on order/numbering of [xinput](http://www.x.org/archive/current/doc/man/man1/xinput.1.xhtml) output
